### Greetings random voyager! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal projects space! (Includes electronics and programming projects, not just programming ones)

**Note: my old username was DADi590** (and no, DADi is not read "daddy" xD).

### Here's a bit about me:

I'm one of those people with old-gen CPUs from the last millenium (in my case, from the end of '99) - possibly a reason for not working so well, because weird glitches happen sometimes, like me putting decorations in wall outlets or various other perfectly \[and even more\] normal things.

It's still good enough for me to do some cool things though, which you can find in my repositories, and the currently most important for me are super-pinned just below. I love to do something useful that enables me to be creative (else it's boring) and learn new things along the way.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- - a simple Operating System to learn how they work (maybe I try a bootloader next, and I'd love to modify some computer BIOS, even if just some string... xD)
- - a Linear DC Power Supply to be the one on my home bench to power other projects of mine that are on hold until this gets done
- - a forever being developed virtual assistant, V.I.S.O.R.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Electrical and Computer Engineering at university, and programming and messing with electronics (check the repos here for both things) in my free time (trying to fix and/or improve devices I have, and also make things, like the PSU I mentioned)
- âœ¨ Some ideas I like: IoT, low-level programming and Reverse Engineering, and electronics
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: anything you'd like - in my social media, an Issue [here](https://github.com/DADi590/DADi590/issues), or a Discussion [here](https://github.com/DADi590/DADi590/discussions).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love Superheroes movies (Marvel/DC)
