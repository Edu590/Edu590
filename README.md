### Greetings random voyager! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my programming experiences personal space!

#### Here's a bit about me:

I'm one of those people with old-gen CPUs from the last millenium (in my case, from the end of '99) - possibly a reason for not working so well, because weird glitches happen sometimes, like me putting decorations in wall outlets and powering the house down, or laying in a mooving walkway (hospital came next), or various other perfectly normal things.

It's still good enough for me to do some cool things though, which you can find in my repositories (for programming projects, that is), and the currently most important for me are super-pinned just below. I love to do something useful that enables me to be creative (else it's boring) and learn new things along the way.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: making a simple Operating System to learn how they work (maybe I try a bootloader next, and I'd love to modify some computer BIOS, even if just some string... xD); and I'm also making a Linear DC Power Supply to be the one on my home bench to power other projects of mine that are on hold until this gets done.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Electrotechnical and Computer Engineering at university, and programming (check the repos here) and messing with electronics in my free time (trying to fix and/or improve devices I have, and also make things, like a PSU)
- âœ¨ Some ideas I like: low-level programming and Reverse Engineering, and electronics
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: anything you'd like - in my social media, an Issue [here](https://github.com/DADi590/DADi590/issues), or a Discussion [here](https://github.com/DADi590/DADi590/discussions).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love Marvel movies
<!--- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: ...-->

Nickname note: no, DADi is not pronounced like "daddy", and has absolutely nothing to do with that word, contrary to what everyone who comes across the name thinks xD. "590" has no meaning at all (random addition to the nickname in 2012).
