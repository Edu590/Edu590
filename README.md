### Greetings random voyager! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal projects space! (Includes electronics and programming projects. Not just programming ones.)

#### Here's a bit about me:

\[Nickname note: no, DADi is not pronounced like "daddy", and has absolutely nothing to do with that word, contrary to what everyone who comes across the name thinks xD. "590" has no meaning at all (random addition to the nickname in 2012).\]

I'm one of those people with old-gen CPUs from the last millenium (in my case, from the end of '99) - possibly a reason for not working so well, because weird glitches happen sometimes, like me putting decorations in wall outlets or various other perfectly \[and even more\] normal things.

It's still good enough for me to do some cool things though, which you can find in my repositories, and the currently most important for me are super-pinned just below. I love to do something useful that enables me to be creative (else it's boring) and learn new things along the way.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- - a simple Operating System to learn how they work (maybe I try a bootloader next, and I'd love to modify some computer BIOS, even if just some string... xD)
- - a Linear DC Power Supply to be the one on my home bench to power other projects of mine that are on hold until this gets done
- - a forever being developed virtual assistant, V.I.S.O.R.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Electrical and Computer Engineering at university, and programming and messing with electronics (check the repos here for both things) in my free time (trying to fix and/or improve devices I have, and also make things, like the PSU I mentioned)
- âœ¨ Some ideas I like: IoT, low-level programming and Reverse Engineering, and electronics
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: anything you'd like - in my social media, an Issue [here](https://github.com/DADi590/DADi590/issues), or a Discussion [here](https://github.com/DADi590/DADi590/discussions).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love Superheroes movies (Marvel/DC)
<!--- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: ...
